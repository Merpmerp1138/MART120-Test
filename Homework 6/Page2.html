        <h2>Miles "Tails" Prower</h2>

        <p>There was once a brilliant young fox enjoying the scenery of a brilliant sunny day. This fox had two bright yellow tails. Unfortunately however, not everyone thought his tails were cool, and two mean bullies stopped the fox, calling him names and pulling at his extra tails.
        </p>

        <p>But suddenly, as if the wind itself was coming to his aid, a brilliant streak of blue flashed by disorienting and distracting the bullies giving the fox enough time to slip away. Fascinated by the blue blur the fox became determined to follow where it was going. Little did he know just how much adventure he would find along the way.
