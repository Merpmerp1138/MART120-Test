I honestly feel like I need a mixture of all of the different learning styles for different situations. Sometimes verbal instructions are fantastic and sometimes they fly over my head. Sometimes I can easily pick out what I need to do by just reading instructions and sometimes the words mix together and it might as well be in a different language. Sometimes I can physically test something out in practice and learn really fast and other times I find that I could have learned so much more if someone had just explained it in words. I even find that I sometimes need all three for one learning problem as well. For instance, if Iâ€™m trying to memorize something I often have to read it, write it down, and stay it out loud several times before I even have a chance at getting it to stick. I honestly really dislike the idea of choosing just one style because I know my brain well enough now that just sticking to one solution will never work for me.
