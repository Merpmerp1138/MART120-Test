I actually really enjoyed listening to the last lecture. There were several little things that stuck with me. For example, the idea of head fakes teaching you something through experiences and thinking that you’re learning something else was interesting. It was also really cool to see how many people he affected by sharing what he loved and what he’s learned. Filling up an entire auditorium for just presenting final projects is impressive. I also really liked what he had to say about how just reaching for his dreams sometimes gave him more experience then achieving them ever would. I think overall however, the thing that stuck with me the most was the stuff about the brick walls and how they are only there to prove how much you want something. I know that I have run into some brick walls before myself, however in my case they actually helped me realize that pushing through it wasn’t really what I wanted in life, so now I can go search for a new dream that I actually want to go fight for.
